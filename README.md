# Encrypter

Hi wave, I'm Manuel Ayala, a passionate frontend developer from El Salvador, I’m currently learning on oracle one + alura latam, I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT.

This is an encrypt decrypt website, you can type any text on the input space that says "Type your text here", after that just click the blue button that say "Encrypt" and your encripted text it'll appear on the right white input, the image with the man watching the dyamond will be hidden, it has another button that says "Copy", that's copy your encrypted text and then you can pasted to the left input and now click the second button that says "Decrypt".

I made this project to learn semantic html5, css3 and javascript.
